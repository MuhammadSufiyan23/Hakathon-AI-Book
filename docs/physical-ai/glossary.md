# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a robot that converts energy into motion. Common types include electric motors, hydraulic systems, and pneumatic systems.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## B

**Balance Control**: The ability of a robot to maintain its center of mass within its support polygon to avoid falling.

**Behavior-Based Robotics**: An approach to robotics that structures the robot's control system as a collection of task-oriented behaviors.

## C

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent movements a mechanical system can make. For a robot, this typically refers to the number of independent joints.

## D

**Digital AI**: Traditional AI systems that operate primarily in abstract, symbolic domains without necessarily understanding physical constraints.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence**: The principle that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment, emphasizing the role of physical embodiment in cognition.

**End Effector**: The device at the end of a robot arm that interacts with the environment, such as a gripper or tool.

## F

**Force/Torque Sensor**: A sensor that measures the forces and torques applied to the robot, particularly important for manipulation tasks.

## G

**Gazebo**: A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics simulation and rendering.

**Gyroscope**: A device that measures angular velocity and is used to determine orientation and rotation.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with human-like characteristics, typically having a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The field of study focusing on the design and implementation of robots for interaction with humans.

## I

**Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

## K

**Kinematics**: The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion.

## L

**LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances.

## M

**Manipulation**: The branch of robotics focused on the control of robot hands and arms to interact with objects in the environment.

## P

**Physical AI**: AI systems that integrate understanding of physical laws and real-world dynamics to interact with the physical environment.

**Prismatic Joint**: A type of joint that allows linear sliding movement between two bodies.

## R

**Revolute Joint**: A type of joint that allows rotational movement between two bodies.

**Robot Operating System (ROS)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

**ROS 2**: The second generation of the Robot Operating System with improved architecture for real-world applications.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate and complete understanding of the environment.

**Six-Axis Force/Torque Sensor**: A sensor that measures forces in three directions (X, Y, Z) and torques about three axes (roll, pitch, yaw).

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format used in ROS to describe robot models, including kinematic and dynamic properties.

## V

**Velocity Controller**: A control system that commands joint velocities to achieve desired motion.

## W

**Whole-Body Control**: A control approach that considers all the degrees of freedom of a robot simultaneously to achieve multiple tasks.

## Y

**Yaw**: The rotation of an object about its vertical (Z) axis.
