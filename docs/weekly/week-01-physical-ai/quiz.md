## Answer Key

1. B) Physical AI integrates understanding of physical laws and real-world dynamics
2. C) Third Law (Action-ReAction)
3. B) False (LIDAR uses laser light, not radio waves)
4. Embodied intelligence is the principle that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. It's important in Physical AI because it emphasizes the role of physical embodiment in cognition, which is essential for systems that must interact with the physical world.
5. C) Inertial Measurement Unit
6. B) LIDAR
7. A) True
8. Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate and complete understanding of the environment. One benefit is redundancy, which provides backup if one sensor fails.
9. A) Unified Robot Description Format
10. D) LIDAR
